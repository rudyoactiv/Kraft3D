## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Kraft3D is built with modern web technologies, focusing on performance, maintainability, and scalability.

### **Frontend**

- **React**: The website‚Äôs frontend is developed with **React** to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Components are organized to streamline the user journey from browsing products to completing a purchase.
- **React Router**: This is used to manage routing across multiple pages, allowing smooth navigation.
- **Redux**: **Redux** handles state management, particularly for the cart and user sessions, ensuring that changes across pages are consistent.
- **Styled Components**: Styling is managed through **Styled Components** for modular and easily reusable CSS, maintaining a clean and uniform look throughout the platform.

### **Backend**

- **Node.js & Express**: The server side is powered by **Node.js** with **Express** for routing and handling API requests. All core operations, including product listings, orders, user authentication, and workshop bookings, are managed through RESTful API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A **MongoDB** database is utilized for storing and retrieving data. Collections include products, users, orders, and bookings, structured to support rapid access and updates.
- **JWT Authentication**: Security is ensured with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, protecting user and admin sessions and enabling secure access to sensitive operations.

This tech stack allows Kraft3D to deliver a high-performance, scalable ecommerce solution optimized for both users and administrators.
